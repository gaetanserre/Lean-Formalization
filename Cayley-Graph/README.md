## Lean Formalization of Cayley's Graph

This directory contains the formalization of the representation of finite groups as Cayley's graphs.

The formalizations are done in the following files:
- `CayleyGraph/finGroup.lean`: Definition of finite groups, formulas (to represent the edges), generative families, free families and free groups.
- `CayleyGraph/Graph.lean`: Definition of Cayley's graph, proof of equivalence between properties of the group and its corresponding Cayley's graph.
